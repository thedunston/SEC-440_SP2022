Open Source Thin Client

Thin-OS is a custom operating system that is lightweight and versatile, designed to be used on any thin client. The Os is built using Xubuntu Core and features a custom-made GUI built with bash scripting. This GUI contains programs that allow the user to easily connect to a VPN and 
RDP or SSH to any computer it has access to. This OS is designed to be as light as possible and at 1.2 GB it is quite lightweight. The OS has been set up for USB boot with or without persistent storage as well as PXE boot (currently a work in progress).


HoneyPot Project

Hi there! My group's project was to create an intentionally insecure small business network to gather data on potential attackers. Using an Elastic Stack we are able to capture data from all of the machines on the network and create detailed reports on breaches once they occur. Then others can use this data to help protect themselves against these threats. Our main point of entry into the network is a public facing RDP 
Client with very weak passwords. Once attackers breach that box, they can then propagate across the network to the other devices, all in a safe environment that does not put any real infrastructure in danger.

Sandbox Project

Daniel Hellstern

Sandbox Project: In the first half of this semester, I tested two popular application sandboxing programs, Sandboxie and Windows Sandbox. I considered and documented their compatibility and performance on modern computing systems, applicability for day-to-day use, and effectiveness against different types of malware. I also tested methods of improving the usability of Windows Sandbox to make it more applicable to additional day-to-day use cases.
Browser Testing Project: I will be assembling and testing a dataset of known malicious or otherwise unwanted websites against popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and AVG Secure Browser, to determine the efficacy of their built-in malicious site blocking and warning.

OSQuery Training Course
Richie Nadeau

https://rich-nadeau.gitbook.io/osquery-training/info/what-is-osquery

On my project, I am developing a training course for an open source service called OSQuery that allows its users to pull device details using SQL commands. In this training course, I will be teaching people that are interested in this service how to install OSQuery on different hosts, install and set up FleetDM to run queries on multiple OSQuery hosts remotely, and which queries to run to detect different malware.

Velociraptor Training Course

The Velociraptor Training Course is a gitbook tutorial all about using the advanced digital forensic and incident response tool: Velociraptor. The tutorial includes an overview of installing and deploying the tool, documentation on how to navigate the tool, documentation on utilizing the tool to query a Linux and Windows system, and is soon to include lessons about threat investigation and emulation.
